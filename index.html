        <h2><strong>Cloud Computing In Bodoland</strong></h2>
hello everyone, and so as we can see that we have  a very big problem in our province right now, and that is that there are almost no cloud computing companies/service providers in our province, due to which we are facing a lot of problems , if we bring cloud computing here in our province, then many problems will be solved as well as we will get many benefits
<h4>some benefits we will get when we bring cloud computing in bodoland</h4>
1. Many people will get jobs
2. Colocation will be much faster with very less latencies as we will be building our own data centers in bodoland
3. the internet speed will be much faster &amp; cheaper as we will be building multiple internet backbones
4. telecom companies will be able to use/share our network &amp; resources to build a better network for the future
5. IT students, entrepreneurs &amp; researchers will be able to use our resources for their projects.
and so on
<h4>Our Aim</h4>
the aim of our company is to develop/make our province modern and better by  to providing cloud services like cloud servers(IaaS hosting), Colocation, cloud mailing systems, PaaS hosting, Content Delivery Network, web-development &amp; building highspeed fiber network, providing networking solutions, etc
<h4>How did we come up with this idea ?</h4>
we started this idea just a few days ago on a facebook group, where we wanted to develop a new project in bodoland, where people will be able to create websites very easily, very similar to ‘Wix’ &amp; ‘Squarespace’. which would have free as well as premium features.
but right now, we couldn’t start this service as because we need a lot of cloud servers to keep the service running and for that we require some
funding/investment, but right now we didn’t have much, so we are looking for investors who can help us. but however we are still developing it, in a small scale
<h4> So, How to we Start</h4>
at first we will start small, we will form a team and we will gather some investment,
