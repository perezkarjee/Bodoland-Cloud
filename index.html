<h2><strong>Cloud Computing In Bodoland</strong></h2>
hello everyone, and so as we can see that we have  a very big problem in our province right now,
and that is that there are almost no cloud computing companies/service providers in our province, due to 
which we are facing a lot of problems , if we bring cloud computing services here in our province, then 
many problems will be solved as well as we will get many benefits
<h4>some benefits that we will get when we bring cloud computing in bodoland</h4>
1. Many people will get jobs<br>
2. Colocation will be much faster with very less latencies as we will be building our own data centers in bodoland<br>
3. the internet speed will be much faster &amp; cheaper as we will be building multiple internet backbones<br>
4. telecom companies will be able to use/share our network &amp; resources to build a better network for the future<br>
5. IT students, entrepreneurs &amp; researchers will be able to use our resources for their projects.<br>
and so on
<h4>Our Aim</h4>
the aim of our company is to develop/make our province modern and better by  to providing cloud
services like cloud servers(IaaS hosting), Colocation, cloud mailing systems, PaaS hosting, 
Content Delivery Network, web-development & building highspeed fiber network, providing networking solutions, etc
<h4>How did we come up with this idea ?</h4>
we started this idea just a few days ago on a facebook group, where we wanted to develop a new PaaS service in bodoland, where people will be able to create websites very easily, very similar to ‘Wix’ & ‘Squarespace’. which would have free as well as premium features.
but right now, we couldn’t start this service as because we need a lot of cloud servers to keep the service running and for that we require some
funding/investment, but right now we didn’t have much, so we are looking for investors who can help us. but however we are still developing it, in a small scale
<h4> So, How to we Start</h4>
at first we will start small, we will form a team and we will gather some investment,
So, How to we Start

at first we will start small, we will form a team and we will gather some investment, and then we will form many small 
sub teams such as DevOps team for maintaining our services, Sales & Advertising team for growing our sales, Support 
team for providing customer support, etc, etc. as we will be starting as a small company, so first we will deploy some
of our cloud products(that we discussed earlier) on IaaS services like Amazon Web Services, Rackspace, Digitalocean, 
etc. soon after than our customers will start growing & we will start making profits. by then we will start building 
our own datacenters in multiple places in bodoland. and also provide services like Colocation & dedicated servers to 
our local as well as national & international customers. and also after that we will start building our own highspeed 
fiber network in our province so that everyone can have faster and cheaper internet access, and so on, we will continue 
making our province a better & modern place as we grow bigger and bigger
